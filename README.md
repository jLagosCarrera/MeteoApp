<h2 align="center">Introduction</h2>

MeteoApp is an application developed entirely during my 3 month FCT internship on GBtec Software.  

The main purpose of the application is learning about web development. The use of Javascript ES6+, modern framework like AngularJS, useful libraries used on big applications like uiRouter or Redux and handling geoNames and openWeatherMaps API calls for filtering the data retrieved by them. With all these new concepts and technologies learnt I was able to create and deploy a standard modern weather web application.

<h2 align="center">Local deploy</h2>

If you want to deploy this application locally on your computer you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) which comes along with the Node installation.  

Download this repository and after the download you need to add an .env file on the root folder of the application with the following API keys you can get for free:
- [openWeatherMaps API Key](https://openweathermap.org/appid).
- [geoNames API Key](https://www.geonames.org/export/).  

```text
OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY=(openWeatherMaps API Key)
GEONAMES_API_KEY=(geoNames API Key)
```  

After this you are almost ready to go, just open a terminal on the repository folder and run the following commands:
- **_dev_** -> Runs server locally on port 9000.
- **_build_** -> Generates a build of the web on the dist folder.

```bash
npm i

npm run dev
npm run build
```

<h2 align="center">Dependencies</h2>

- [angular](https://angularjs.org/): Framework used for the dynamic build of the application.
- [angular-material](https://material.angularjs.org/): Used for implementing UI components into the application.
- [angular-animate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-animate): Allow material components animations.
- [angular-aria](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-aria): Allows material components accesibility.
- [angular-messages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-messages): Allows material components messages content display.
- [material-icons](https://marella.github.io/material-icons/): Used for displaying material design icons.  
- [redux](https://redux.js.org/): Library used to work with the state of the application.
- [ng-redux](https://github.com/angular-redux/ng-redux): Implementation of redux to AngularJS.  
- [uiRouter](https://ui-router.github.io/): Manage of the application screens and routing.

<h2 align="center">Known Issues</h2>

Known issues of the application are opened on the [issues section](https://github.com/jLagosCarrera/MeteoApp/issues) of this repository. All of them are labeled and every new issue will be evaluated and solved so feel free to open a new issue if you find a problem or if you have any suggestion for the application.

<h2 align="center">Contributing and Support</h2>

Same as the known issues. Contributing is free and always welcome. I'm accepting every kind of contributions, going from little updates like typo corrections to big updates like new screens of the application and functionallities so feel free to make a new Pull Request!  

If you find any trouble or problem with the app just let me know opening a new issue on this repo or contact me on [julio.lagos.carrera@gmail.com](mailto:julio.lagos.carrera@gmail.com)
